TechHub is a Rust-idiomatic, production-grade platform powered by Actix Web and PostgreSQL. Built with TDD and comprehensive end-to-end black-box tests.

Offers post creation with full-text search and pagination, comments, likes, and admin-driven newsletters to users powered by background workers for async and idempotent email delivery.

Implements hexagonal architecture and domain modeling with compile-time validation via Rust’s type system. Features a full authentication system including user registration, login, transactional email confirmation, secure password reset, and token-based session authentication, built on concurrency and distributed-systems-safe transactions under strict Postgres isolation guarantees.

Delivers full-fledged telemetry with tracing spans, performance metrics, and error handling at the right level of abstraction. Deployed using multi-stage Docker builds on AWS ECS with RDS and ElastiCache (Redis) for reliable, scalable operation.
